# base_JavaProjTools_Math
Vector, Matrix, and other Math tools for Java Projects


This code builds a .jar that holds point, vector, matrix, matrix stack, various interpolants, and other math functionality I use in my Java projects.  This code originally was in the UI lib.

All future math code, including prob/stat functionality, will reside in this library.
